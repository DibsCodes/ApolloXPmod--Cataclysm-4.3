# ApolloXPmod--Cataclysm-4.3
 A world of Warcraft Addon for Cataclysm 4.3.4 -- Specifically the Apollo private servers

The Apollo private server allows you to change your xp rate on the server anywhere from 1x-3x using a chat command, ".mod xp __"  However, the setting does not stay when you log out or /reload, and will default back to 3x.

This addon will automatically send that chat command and set your xp to the desired rate every time you log in. It also has a level cap feature. If you're like me and like to keep your xp rate low for the first 20 levels or so, then jump back up to 3x after that, you can simply set a cap and then the addon will revert back to 3x once you reach that cap.
